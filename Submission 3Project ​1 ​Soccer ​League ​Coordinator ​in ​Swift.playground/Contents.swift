/*
 The purpose of this code it to divide  18 children who have signed up for the league into three even teams â€” Dragons, Sharks, and Raptors. This code is divided into 3 parts.
 
Part 1 Uses the information for the 18 players in the Player Info spreadsheet and stores them into individual arrays. This part then uses these individual arrays and creates a collection named theLeague.
 
 Part 2: Creates a logic to iterate through all 18 players and divides them into two groups: experienced and inexerienced players. Next, this part divides these players into the three teams such that the number of experienced players on each team are the same.
 
Part 3: Iterates through all three teams of players and generates a personalized letter to the guardians, letting them know which team the child has been placed on and when they should attend their first team team practice.

 The following information has been provided:
